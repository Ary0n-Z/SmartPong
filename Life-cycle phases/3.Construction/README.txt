The primary objective is to build the software system.
 In this phase, the main focus is on the development of components and other features of the system. 
This is the phase when the bulk of the coding takes place.
In larger projects, several construction iterations may be developed in an effort to divide the use cases into manageable segments produce demonstrable prototypes.
